# User Configuration System - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the user configuration system in ListSync as per the plan outlined in `user-co.plan.md`.

**Date:** December 6, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Phase:** Phase 1 (Verification) + Phase 3 (UI/UX Improvements)

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Verification ✅

**What was checked:**
- Verified `lists` table has `user_id` column (TEXT, default "1")
- Verified `overseerr_users` table exists with correct schema
- Confirmed `config` table stores `overseerr_user_id` for global default

**Results:**
```sql
-- lists table (confirmed)
user_id TEXT DEFAULT "1"

-- overseerr_users table (confirmed)
id TEXT PRIMARY KEY
display_name TEXT NOT NULL
email TEXT
avatar TEXT
created_at TIMESTAMP
last_synced TIMESTAMP

-- config table (confirmed)
key = 'overseerr_user_id', value = '[user_id]'
```

**Status:** ✅ All database structures are correct and functioning as designed.

---

### 2. Setup Wizard Enhancements ✅

**File:** `listsync-nuxt/components/setup/Step1Essential.vue`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Improved Messaging
- **Before:** "Sync users from Seerr and select which user will make requests by default"
- **After:** 
  - "Select which Seerr user will request content by default for all new lists"
  - Added info box: "This will be the default user for all new lists. You can change it per-list later when adding lists."

#### B. Selected User Summary
Added a new summary box that appears after user selection:
```vue
<div class="p-3 rounded-lg bg-green-500/10 border border-green-500/30">
  <p>Default User Selected</p>
  <p>All new lists will request content as: [User Display Name] (ID: X)</p>
</div>
```

#### C. Visual Improvements
- Added `InfoIcon` import for better visual communication
- Enhanced color coding (blue for user section, green for confirmation)
- Display names shown prominently, IDs as secondary info

**Before/After Comparison:**

**Before:**
- User ID shown, unclear what "default" means
- No confirmation of selection
- Could be confusing for multi-user setups

**After:**
- Clear explanation: "default for all new lists"
- Confirmation box shows selected user by name
- Explicit note: "can change per-list later"

---

### 3. Add List Modal Enhancements ✅

**File:** `listsync-nuxt/components/lists/AddListModal.vue`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Selected User Confirmation
Added real-time confirmation box in Step 3:
```vue
<div class="bg-green-500/10 border border-green-500/20">
  <p>This list will request content as:</p>
  <p class="font-semibold">[User Display Name]</p>
</div>
```

#### B. Warning for No Users
Added warning when user list is empty:
```vue
<div class="bg-amber-500/10 border border-amber-500/20">
  <p>No users loaded. The default user (ID: 1) will be used.</p>
  <p>Sync users from Settings → Users</p>
</div>
```

#### C. Improved Layout
- Restructured user selection section with spacing
- Added `AlertCircleIcon` for warnings
- Shows user display name in confirmation, not just ID

**Impact:**
- Users now get immediate visual feedback on which user will make requests
- Clear warning when users haven't been synced
- Better understanding of per-list user assignment

---

### 4. Settings Page Enhancements ✅

**File:** `listsync-nuxt/components/settings/UsersManagement.vue`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Default User Display Section
Added prominent section at the top showing the default user:

```vue
<div class="p-4 rounded-lg bg-blue-500/10 border border-blue-500/20">
  <div class="flex items-start gap-3">
    <StarIcon /> <!-- Indicates "default/important" -->
    <div>
      <p>Default User for New Lists</p>
      <p>All new lists will request content as this user by default</p>
      <!-- User card with avatar, name, email, ID -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### B. Features
- Shows user avatar (Seerr or DiceBear fallback)
- Displays full name, email, and ID
- Explains what "default user" means
- Added `StarIcon` import for visual prominence

**Before/After:**

**Before:**
- Settings page only showed list of users
- No indication of which was the default
- Had to check config manually to know default user

**After:**
- Default user prominently displayed at top
- Clear explanation of its purpose
- Visual card matching user selection in wizard
- Easy to identify at a glance

---

### 5. User Validation & Error Handling ✅

**File:** `list_sync/main.py`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. User Existence Validation
Added validation in `sync_single_list()` function:

```python
# Validate that the user exists in Seerr
from .database import get_overseerr_user_by_id
user_exists = get_overseerr_user_by_id(user_id)

if not user_exists:
    logging.warning(f"User ID {user_id} not found in local database")
    
    # Try to fetch from Seerr directly
    try:
        # Fetch users from Seerr API
        # Check if user_id exists
        if not user_found:
            logging.warning(f"User not found in Seerr. Falling back to user ID 1")
            user_id = '1'
    except Exception as e:
        logging.warning(f"Failed to validate user. Proceeding with user_id {user_id}")
```

#### B. Error Handling Flow
1. **Check local database** for user_id
2. **If not found** → Query Seerr API directly
3. **If still not found** → Fall back to user ID "1" (admin)
4. **Log all steps** for debugging and auditing

#### C. Benefits
- Prevents sync failures due to deleted users
- Graceful fallback to admin user
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- No sync interruption even if user is missing

**Scenarios Handled:**
- ✅ User deleted from Seerr after list creation
- ✅ User database not synced recently
- ✅ Invalid user_id in database
- ✅ Network issues connecting to Seerr

#### Test Categories
1. **Setup Wizard Tests** - User selection and default setting
2. **Settings Page Tests** - Default user display and sync
3. **Add List Modal Tests** - User assignment and validation
4. **Database Tests** - Persistence and integrity
5. **Sync Process Tests** - User ID usage in requests

## 📊 System Architecture Summary

### Current Implementation

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    User Configuration Flow                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. SETUP WIZARD (Step 1)
   ├── User enters Seerr URL & API Key
   ├── Clicks "Sync Users from Seerr"
   ├── Users fetched and stored in overseerr_users table
   ├── User selects default user (e.g., User 2)
   ├── Saved to config.overseerr_user_id = "2"
   └── [NEW] Confirmation box shows selected user by name

2. ADD LIST MODAL (Step 3)
   ├── Opens with default user pre-selected (from config)
   ├── [NEW] Shows confirmation: "This list will request as: [User Name]"
   ├── User can override to different user (e.g., User 1)
   ├── Saved to lists.user_id = "1" (overrides default)
   └── [NEW] Warning shown if no users available

3. SETTINGS PAGE (Users Tab)
   ├── [NEW] Displays default user at top with star icon
   ├── Shows all Seerr users
   ├── "Sync Users" button to refresh from Seerr
   └── Last synced timestamp

4. SYNC PROCESS (Automated/Manual)
   ├── Retrieves user_id from lists.user_id
   ├── [NEW] Validates user exists in overseerr_users table
   ├── [NEW] If missing, checks Seerr API directly
   ├── [NEW] Falls back to user ID "1" if still not found
   ├── Creates OverseerrClient(user_id)
   ├── Makes API requests with X-Api-User: [user_id]
   └── Content requested in Seerr as that user

5. DATABASE STRUCTURE
   ├── config.overseerr_user_id → Global default (e.g., "2")
   ├── overseerr_users → Reference table of all users
   └── lists.user_id → Per-list user override (e.g., "1")
```

### Data Flow Example

```
Scenario: User wants List A as User 1, List B as User 2

Setup:
  overseerr_user_id = "2" (global default)

Add List A:
  User overrides → user_id = "1"
  DB: lists.user_id = "1"

Add List B:
  User accepts default → user_id = "2"
  DB: lists.user_id = "2"

Sync List A:
  → OverseerrClient(user_id="1")
  → Requests made with X-Api-User: 1
  → Content appears in Seerr as "Admin User"

Sync List B:
  → OverseerrClient(user_id="2")
  → Requests made with X-Api-User: 2
  → Content appears in Seerr as "Test User"
```
