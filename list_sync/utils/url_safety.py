"""
Validation for URLs the server is about to fetch.

Several endpoints take a URL from the caller and make the server request it.
Without a check that turns the API into a proxy for whatever the caller can
reach, which on a host with a private network means internal services and
cloud metadata endpoints the caller could never reach directly.

Policy differs by sink, so the caller says what it needs:

  * a Discord webhook only ever lives on Discord, so pass allowed_hosts
  * poster images only ever come from public CDNs, so private addresses are
    rejected outright
  * Seerr legitimately runs on a private address, so private is allowed
    there - but cloud metadata never is, whatever the sink

Known limitation: the hostname is resolved here and resolved again by the HTTP
client, so a name that changes its answer between the two calls can slip past
(DNS rebinding). Closing that needs the connection pinned to the address that
was checked, which is beyond what this helper does. It still removes the
straightforward attacks.
